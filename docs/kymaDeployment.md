# Kyma Deployment

Kyma is a flexible and easy-to-use open-source platform designed to extend and customize enterprise applications in a modern, cloud-native world. It allows developers to build, extend, and deploy cloud-native applications using open-source technologies.  

Kyma comes with a set of pre-packaged components such as service-mesh, serverless computing, eventing, and many others that help to build a foundation for application development. It also provides an environment where you can connect and integrate various systems and applications, whether they are on-premises, on the cloud, or third-party services.  

The advantage of the Kyma environment is its emphasis on event-driven architecture, allowing complex business processes to be captured as a chain of events. This makes building, scaling, and deploying applications easier and more efficient. It is used extensively for its flexibility, customization abilities, and the robust tooling it provides to developers.

## [Requirements](/userGuide.md#prerequisites)
- A Docker Image is necessary for deploying the application on the Kyma runtime environment. Dockerhub can be used for pushing your docker image.
- An SAP BTP account is needed for the application deployment. You can create a trial account by following this link [BTP account](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/)
