## Experience

### Data Science and Security Research Intern
**SAP Labs (March 2023 - August 2023), FR, Mougins**
- Developed an SAP Fiori (UI5) application integrating ledger technologies and REST APIs, significantly enhancing user experience for next-gen analytics security.
- Boosted scalability by containerizing the project with Docker and deploying it on Kubernetes (Kyma) clusters.
- Installed and configured NGINX as a reverse proxy server to handle incoming API requests and distribute them to backend microservices.
- Implemented OAuth 2.0 authorization framework to secure API endpoints and control access to resources.
- Set up an Authorization Server (e.g., using Auth0 or custom implementation) to issue JWT tokens and validate client credentials.
- Configured NGINX to validate OAuth tokens and enforce access policies based on scopes and roles defined in JWT claims.
- Increased KPI anomaly detection accuracy by 5.42% using machine learning-based synthetic data generation techniques, ensuring privacy and security of original data.

### Software Engineer Intern
**Diesel Loco Modernisation Works, Indian Railways (June 2018 - August 2018), IN, Patiala**
